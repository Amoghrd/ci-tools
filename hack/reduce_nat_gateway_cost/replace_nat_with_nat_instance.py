# Important: Be aware of DPP/PCO resource pruning in the OCP CI ephemeral accounts. You must request
# that resources created when installing this solution (e.g. the Lambda & policies) need to be preserved.
#
# This lambda is meant to be installed into an AWS account where you want to dynamically
# replace the use of expensive NAT Gateway network traffic with inexpensive traffic
# through a "NAT instance". A NAT Gateway is a fully managed AWS service which provides NAT functionality
# for EC2 instances on a private network. A NAT instance, in contrast, is a standard EC2 instance that is
# configured to use standard Linux facilities to provide NAT functionality.
# Traffic through a NAT Gateway is charged several cents per GB. Traffic through a
# NAT instance is nearly free (we just pay for the small EC2 instance and its public IP address).
#
# The solution works by listening to events in a AWS account where we install ephemeral OCP clusters
# for testing. An AWS service called EventBridge can be used trigger this lambda function when
# certain events occur. We are interested in this lambda reacting to several events (more on why,
# later):
# 1. The creation of NAT Gateways.
# 2. New EC2 instances starting in the account.
# 3. EC2 instances being terminated in the account.
# 4. The deletion of NAT Gateways.
#
# Using these events to trigger this lambda, we can, transparent to the installer
# or other components of the cluster, create a NAT instance and interject it into
# the running cluster resources such that it provides NAT services to nodes within
# the OCP cluster.
#
# A standard OpenShift cluster uses the following major AWS networking resources:
# 1. A virtual private cloud (VPC) which is a container for most other AWS resources. A VPC
#    resides in a specific region like us-east-1. Regions are split into availability zones (AZs)
#    which are used to provide fault tolerance within a specific AWS region.
# 2. A cluster may run in a single AZ or split itself across multiple AZs for fault tolerance.
#    For example, it may put one master node in us-east-1a, another in us-east-1b, and another
#    in us-east-1c. For each AZ for which a cluster is configured to span, the installation process will
#    create:
#    a. Two subnets. One public and one private. A public subnet is defined as one that possesses
#       an Internet Gateway (IGW). An IGW allows traffic to flow between EC2 instances attached to
#       a public subnet and the Internet IFF the EC2 instance has a public IP address assigned.
#       A private subnet does not have an IGW. EC2 Instances attached to a private subnet, even
#       if they had a public IP address cannot not communicate directly to the Internet with it.
#       Instead, these instances have private IP addresses (e.g. 10.0.29.172) and use a NAT
#       gateway to perform addresses translation to communicate on the Internet. If you curl a "what is my IP"
#       service from an OpenShift node, you will see the public IP address of the NAT gateway,
#       in the AZ for the node and not the node itself (which does not have a public ipv4 in a standard installation).
#    b. A NAT gateway attached to the private subnet.
#    c. An IGW attached to the public network.
#    d. Zero or more master or worker nodes attached to the private network.
#    e. Two RouteTables. One for the public subnet and one for the private. The RouteTable
#       tells AWS how to route network traffic from an instance attached to a subnet. The
#       most important routes in this solution are those in the private subnet's RouteTable.
#       An entry that routes traffic within the private subnet: e.g. 10.0.0.0/19 => local.
#       And an entry that routes outbound traffic to the Internet: 0.0.0.0/0 => NAT Gateway instance Id.
#       This entry is used to route traffic for everything NOT in the private subnet's CIDR.
#
#  The goal of this lambda is to replace this 0.0.0.0/0 route in the private subnet with
#  0.0.0.0/0 => EC2 NAT instance network interface (ENI) where the EC2 instance has been enabled
#  to provide NAT services.
#
# With the knowledge that ephemeral IPI clusters are being created in the AWS account, the
# lambda takes action to provision a NAT instance in each public subnet being used by a cluster.
# Once the NAT instance is ready to handle traffic, it will update the RouteTable for
# the corresponding private subnet associated with the cluster & AZ to route 0.0.0.0/0 traffic
# (i.e. traffic destined for the Internet) to itself. The NAT instance resides in the
# public network and uses the IGW to communicate to the internet on behalf of other
# instances in the cluster to the internet.
# If the instance is shutdown gracefully, it will reverse this process (by way of a systemd unit
# installed by userData on startup) and restore the former route for the NAT gateway to handle
# the traffic. As a backup for a graceful shutdown, the lambda itself will also listen for
# TerminateInstances API calls and, if a master or the NAT instance is targeted, the lambda
# will restore the NAT Gateway route.
#
# The specific actions taken by the lambda are triggered by AWS API calls reported by the AWS
# EventBridge and leading to invocations of the lambda. Those events are as follows:
# 1. CreateNatGateway (the creation of NAT Gateways). We use this as a trigger to try to start the
#    NAT instance that will run in the AZ of the NatGateway.
# 2. New instances starting in the account.
# 3. Instances being terminated in the account. We use this to detect if a master node or NAT instance is being
#    shutdown -- implying the ephemeral cluster is being destroyed -- which we use to restore the NAT Gateway route
#    and the deletion of resources created by the lambda (like the NAT instance).
# 4. DeleteNatGateway - A final attempt is made to clean up in case masters aren't terminated.
#
#  Q: Why don't all installations use NAT instances instead of NAT Gateways? The AWS Gateway
#     resource provides unique HA features that are complex to replicate. It does not require
#     any operational oversight. For example, keeping a NAT instance patched & secure requires
#     it to be updated and rebooted, but during the reboot, traffic must be routed around it to prevent a
#     network disruption. Similarly, if a NAT instance malfunctions after running for a
#     long period of time, as software tends to do, that must be detected and a procedure
#     must be in place to detect and recover from the problem.
#     Our ephemeral clusters, however, are short-lived. In the extremely unlikely situation
#     where a NAT instance fails over that short lifespan, we can tolerate a test failure .
#
#  Q: What if the NAT instance does not come up?
#  A: The change to the RouteTable is performed by the startup script run by the instance
#     (i.e. the AWS userData). If the NAT instance does not come up successfully, it will
#     not change the route and the cluster will use the NAT Gateway.
#
#  Q: What if that NAT instance / other resources crated by the lambda fail to be cleaned up by
#     the lambda?
#  A: We should monitor this, but ultimately the DPP pruner should delete
#     any stragglers.
